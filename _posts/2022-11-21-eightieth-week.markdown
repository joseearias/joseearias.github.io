This week’s entry will be a short one. This is the final week to finish our to-do application. And honestly not much has changed from last week. Some things were done and some things had to get fixed. 

The things that I’m still working to implement are:

-Getting the correct error message gets displayed on the front end
-Implementing the pagination correctly
-Making sure the names of the tasks are unique on the back end

So even though both parts of the application, the front end and back end, are practically done, there are a lot of things to fix so that both of them can work together. 

I’m hoping that I can finish all the requirements. There are a lot of tests to do and I need to make sure that all the individual parts work together by the end of this week. 

To be honest I’m still learning each day from the mistakes and fixes I have to make for my code, and I've been thinking a lot recently about how I would do things if I had to do the same project all over again. But for the moment I’ll concentrate on getting this assignment done as soon as possible.

Let’s see how next week goes.
