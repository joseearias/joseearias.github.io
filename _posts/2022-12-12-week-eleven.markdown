For this week I spent a lot of my time learning Spring and Spring Boot. Honestly I was a little terrified by them at first, but the more experience I’m getting with them the more I learn to appreciate them as well. I also had to give my second lighting talk where I talked a little bit about Functional Programming.

## Lightning Talks’ Second Round

This week my topic was Functional Programming. The reason why I chose it was because when I was introduced to this programming paradigm, it really helped me to become a better developer, because it changed how I view the code I write. I think everyone that writes code can use the basic concepts of Functional Programming to improve their skills.

Overall I think I did a lot better than last week. I was a lot less nervous and surprisingly not sticking to the script that I previously wrote helped me a lot. I think having a script can help you to organize the main ideas of your talk but mixing it up with a little improvisation can improve your presentation a lot.

For my next talk I’m choosing to talk about Docker and containers in general. A technology known by most developers but I think people coming from other areas would appreciate learning a little bit about containers and why so many companies and individuals use them to optimize their development environment.

## Working on Hyperskill

This week I also concentrated on finishing the courses from Hyperskill. I think that thanks to the lessons I did this week a lot of things clicked in my head that I struggled to understand when doing my API on Spring Boot for my previous assignment. Especially all the things related to Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control.

Dependency injection is basically providing the instances of objects that an object needs instead of having it construct them itself. It's a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out. All this is done in Spring thanks to IoC or Inversion of Control, that gives the control of creating these instances to the Spring IoC container where the instances are stored as Beans. All these Beans stored on the IoC container can be used by the whole application when they are needed. This all helps building your application easier, because as a developer you don’t need to worry about object dependencies, you can pass that work to the framework.

I realized how much I enjoy programming in Java. It’s funny because months ago I would’ve frowned upon the idea of using Java for anything, but now I realize how much I misunderstood it. I don’t really know why I never took the time to learn it, I think I never saw the use of it, having used C and C++ in university for most of my low level programming related projects and Python for most of my web development and more high level stuff. Java is not as forgiving as Python, but it basically makes you pay more attention to your coding. And working with Java has helped me understand more Object Oriented related concepts. I also finally saw the usefulness of design patterns, something that I’ve struggled to see in the past.
