This was the first week after delivering the final version of my todo app. It was a little bit more relaxed than previous weeks, so I took the time to unwind for a couple of days. But that’s not to say I didn’t do any work during the week, on the contrary, I took my time to get as much done as possible with the free time I didn’t have in previous weeks.

For our next assignment we need to prepare 3 lightning talks, each with a time limit of 10, 7 and 5 minutes respectively. For my fist talk I choose to talk about Vite, the JS building tool, and how it makes your React developing experience much better. I chose this topic because honestly one of the most annoying things that I went through when developing React applications was the time it took to get my application up and running, and learning about Vite and JS building tools in general was an eye opener for me.

Honestly I feel like I could have made it so much better. When the time came to give my presentation I was already pretty nervous. English is not my native language, but I would say that I feel very confident in my speaking abilities, but maybe it was because there were a lot of people from the company listening to me, I botched my pronunciation and pace more than what I would’ve liked. But at least I know now how to prepare better for next time.

For my next talk, because we have to choose a topic related to software development, I’m choosing to talk about Functional Programming. I chose this topic because a couple of years ago I read a book called Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, written by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman, which basically is an introduction to programming using the functional paradigm. Before I read it I wasn’t sure if it was worth reading it, because I didn't know if reading a whole book whose main target was people entering into the world of programming was worth the hours of time investment, but I soon realized that even though it was used as an introductory book to programming, it had a lot to offer to programmers who never had the chance to dig into functional programming. 

Other than preparing my next presentations, I’m still working on completing the Java Backend Development path of Hyperskill. I’m halfway through the first course and I’m hoping that I can finish it by the end of this week. Right now I have no blockers with this assignment, especially after developing my REST API on Spring Boot for the previous assignment, which helped me grab a hold to most .

I also want to work a little bit more on my organization and time scheduling. This school semester is finished and I want to make it so that in my free time I can do my research on how to be more proficient with my time.
