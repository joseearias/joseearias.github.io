Hi, there! My name is José. This is the first entry from what I hope are many to come in the next couple of months where I document everything that I’ve learned during the week as a part of Encora’s Apprentice Program. This is the first time doing something like this so excuse me if I’m not that good at this writing stuff.

I’m using Github Pages and Jekyll to serve this blog. 

This week we were assigned some algorithmic problems that we needed to solve as a team in 4 different programming languages, these being Python, Dart, Kotlin and Typescript. These problems are part of the problems used in Google’s Code Jam coding competition for the 2022 edition. As a team we decided that the best course of action was to each select an individual problem in the programming language of our choice to try to tackle it. So I decided to use Typescript, because although I’m used to code in Javascript I’ve never taken the time to use or learn TS before, so I thought this would be a good time to get familiar with it.

Starting to learn a new programming language is always fun. Of course, that’s not to say there’s always little things you have to get the hang of before you can actually start using said programming language to actually make stuff. This week I had the task of learning the basics of Typescript, which I didn’t have much problems doing because of it being a superset of Javascript. But because of Typescript being basically Javascript with static typing, it has some of the same ____ that you had to deal with when using JS. 

Because of the nature of the tests that Google uses for Code Jam, the input that each program needs and how you get that input follows a specific format depending on the programming language used for a problem. When using a programming language like Python this is not a problem. Using the function `input()` and applying some operations on the data received is enough to get the input that you need, and usually when coding in Javascript the most common used method for getting input from the user is by using the function`prompt()` which displays a dialog box that prompts the user for input. but when dealing with console input that is another case completely.
