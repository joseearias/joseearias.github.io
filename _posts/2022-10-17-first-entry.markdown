Hi, there! My name is José. This is the first entry from what I hope are many to come in the next couple of months where I document everything that I’ve learned during the week as a part of Encora’s Apprentice Program. This is the first time doing something like this so excuse me if I’m not that good at this writing stuf.

I’m using Github Pages and Jekyll to serve this blog. 

This week we were assigned some algorithmic problems that we needed to solve as a team in 4 different programming languages, these being Python, Dart, Kotlin and Typescript. These problems are part of the problems used in Google’s Code Jam coding competition for the 2022 edition. As a team we decided that the best course of action was to each select an individual problem in the programming language of our choice to try to tackle it. So I decided to use Typescript, because although I’m used to code in Javascript I’ve never taken the time to use or learn TS before, so I thought this would be a good time to get familiar with it.
