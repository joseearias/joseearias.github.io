After one month of being part of the Apprentice Program of Encora, I can say a lot of things have changed. This last month has helped me to grow more confident with my own abilities and look at my obstacles from another perspective. That’s not to say I haven’t struggled with a lot of the assignments that we were given during this period. But where in the past I used to dwell for too long with these struggles, now I’ve learned how to tackle them in better and more efficient ways. I can confidently say that all the good habits that I’ve been sticking with for the last month have helped me to overcome most of the blockers I’ve encountered during this time.

This week we were given our first “real” development project assignment. To build a web app from the ground up. Learning algorithms and data structures it’s nice and interesting, and of course, it helps you to be a better developer but at least for me, building a project that you can actually see grow step by step, commit by commit, bug fix by bug fix, it’s what actually made me fall in love with coding. The deadline for this project is in one month, so it’s all a matter of delivering a functional web application when the time comes.

For this assignment, as I previously mentioned we have to develop a web application from the ground up, a “to do” list application. To do this we have to build both the front end and the back end of the application. We were asked to use React.js for the front end, and Java and Spring Boot for the back end.

I decided to start with the front end, as I feel comfortable enough with React at this point to just dive through this part of the assignment. Of course, there’s MANY things I haven’t learned yet about this framework, but the requirements for the front end are not that complicated so I’m expecting this can be done quickly enough to concentrate on the back end of the app. 

Being asked to use Java for the back end it’s a little bit scary as the only programming languages I have touched in the past for the back end of my applications have been Python with Django and Flask, and a little bit of Javascript with Express. Learning Spring Boot really makes me appreciate the simplicity of Django and Django Rest Framework to create an out of the box REST API. Of course, that simplicity comes with its costs but for the little toy projects I have done until now that has been enough. Developing a web app with Java comes with its many moving parts and dependencies that you have to manage. It’s not as intuitive as using Django or Flask, but Boot being an opinionated starter pack as well makes the transition not a little bit easier.

I took the time this week to learn at a fast pace the syntax of Java and some of its quirks. And I’m hoping that this next week I can start coding the API for the back end of the application, while I work on finishing the front end.

Just before finishing this entry I want to give a shout out to all members of Encora that have helped me during these last weeks and I hope that if (*fingers crossed*) I graduate from the Apprentice Program, I can be of as much help to someone else in the future.
