Although there weren’t many assignments this week I felt as if I really got a lot out of the ones I had. This last week I concentrated on finishing my current Spring Boot project on Hyperskill and I also gave my third and final lightning talk. I’ll talk a little bit about them in this week's entry.

This week I presented my final lightning talk, the topic I chose to talk about was Docker and containerization. I chose this topic because I remember reading about Docker a couple of years ago and I was so interested in the uses of it that I started learning how to use it before even coding my first web application.

I really think that I did a better job this time than my two previous presentations. The one thing that I think I need to work on is the pace in which I talk when I’m presenting. I believe the 5 minute time limit had a lot to do with that, but still, I need to practice so that next time something like this comes up in the future I can do a better job expressing my ideas at a better pace. 

For this project I built an API for a cinema theater. Because this is a Java course focusing on Spring and Spring Boot development this application was built using the aforementioned technologies. You can find my Github repository for this project [here](https://github.com/joseearias/cinema-room-rest-service).

After I finished this project I learnt how to implement some of the functionalities that my previous to-do application project lacked, like correct exception handling. I’ll try to implement these functionalities on the to-do application so that I can get it to work as I originally intended to since the beginning. 

I think the Hyperskill platform has its ups and downs but overall it has been a really fruitful experience so far. I like how it gives you a pretty simplified path to learn the skills you need to acquire before completing a part of your project, but in some cases I felt as if some topics could’ve been explained a little bit better.

For this next week I’m planning on continuing to work on Hyperskill, and in my free time I want to apply the same concepts that I have learned about back end and API development with a Node and Express project.
