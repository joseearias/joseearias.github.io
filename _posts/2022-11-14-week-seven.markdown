For this week I concentrated on getting the last pieces of my application running. There are some details that I need to work on, but I think by the end of this week I will have the final version of the whole application finished. 

There’s not much else to say about the front end, because it hasn’t changed that much since my last post. The only things to work on are the tests of the applications and making little improvements to the design so it’s a little more easy on the eyes. Other than that it’s just making sure that the data received by the API is displayed correctly on the front end.

For my Rest API that serves as the back end of the application I already have all the endpoints working, including the validation for these. Because of the limitations given to us by the Apprentice Staff we couldn’t use the JPA dependency and all its tools. So this meant that we needed to code and implement all the functionalities of each HTTP method on our own. Honestly when I first heard of this I was a little worried, because I thought at the moment that doing a project from scratch with a new technology was complicated enough for the time we had, and not being able to use one of the fundamentals given by the framework added to the complexity of the assignment. But later I realized that this wasn’t as difficult as I thought it would be at first.

One of the most difficult things to grasp when learning Spring and Spring Boot is dependency injection, which is when Spring injects objects into other objects or dependencies. This makes our programming code loosely coupled, making it easier to manage and test the application. At first it is really difficult to see how this works under the hood, but the more you spend coding and trying things on your application the more you can actually comprehend it. 

I think overall I’m feeling more confident in my abilities as a web developer. I’m thinking of doing some other projects using Spring Boot, just to keep implementing and trying the things I’ve been learning on my own. And getting a project done with a framework and even with a programming language I haven’t used much in the past have made me motivated enough to try other new technologies.
