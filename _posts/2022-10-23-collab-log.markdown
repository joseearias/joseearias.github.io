# PROBLEM 5. Twisty Little Passages

## OVERVIEW 

Twisty Little Passages is a problem that deals with probability and importance sampling. You are given the total rooms and the number of operations that you can do for every case. You need to implement a way of asking the user every move you want to do by teleporting and walking a total of K times, getting all the degrees possible and also a good estimation of a degree average, this in case there is still rooms left to visit by our K operations. 

In our solution we implemented the following graph formula for edges (passages in problem): 

Edges (Passages) = Î£Degrees/2 

For this type of problems there is no pure scientific correct way of solving, here you need to implement enough heuristics so that you are fairly certain that you are close to a good estimate. 


## CONTEXT 

What is Twisty Little Passages about? 

You are investigating a cave, which is a simple undirected graph with N vertices and no isolated vertices. At the start you are told that the cave has N <= 10^5 rooms. The vertex number you are at and the number of incident edges.  

When in a room, you can identify what room you are in and see how many passages it connects to, but you cannot distinguish the passages. You want to estimate the number of passages that exist in the cave. You are allowed to do up to K = 8000 operations. An operation is either: 

Teleport: You choose to teleport to a vertex number of your choice 

Walk: You choose to be moved to a uniformly chosen random neighbor of the current vertex. 

After each move, you are told the vertex number and the number of incident edges. With this information you have to estimate the number of edges in the graph in an approximation error of 33.3%, and you are to succeed in at least 90% of the test cases.
